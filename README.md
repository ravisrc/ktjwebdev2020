# KSHITIJ Fest Web Development Workshop

## About

Kshitij also called KTJ, is the annual techno-management festival of IIT Kharagpur. Its aim is to provide the technically inclined youthâ€™s generation a national-level platform, where they can show their talents and expertise and would be recognized and rewarded. With a view counter surpassing 10 million, its a task that can't be handled by any individual. So they  require a team for this, a team in which everyone can combine the strengths of different individuals to cover all the aspects of Website management. Thus, they have conducted a workshop to train.
